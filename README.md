# 📂 Python Programming 1st Semester
This repository contains **Python lab programs** from my **BSc. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** coursework. The programs are structured based on five different **units**, covering **fundamental to advanced Python concepts**.   
This collection provides hands-on experience in **control flow, data structures, functions, and modular programming**,  
gradually progressing towards **advanced topics like list comprehensions, lambda functions, and data manipulation using NumPy & Pandas**.  

Each unit is designed to **reinforce algorithmic thinking**, improve **problem-solving skills**,  
and enhance **code efficiency through best practices**.

### 🔹 Unit 1: Python Basics  
- Core syntax and variable assignments  
- Arithmetic operations & precedence  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`, `elif`)  
- Iterative constructs (`for`, `while` loops)  
- String manipulation & basic functions  

### 🔹 Unit 2: Lists & Tuples  
- **Lists**: Creation, indexing, slicing, modification  
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences, tuple packing/unpacking  
- Built-in methods (`append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, etc.)  
- **Searching & sorting algorithms** (linear search, bubble sort)  

### 🔹 Unit 3: Sets & Dictionaries  
- **Set operations**: Union, intersection, difference  
- **Dictionaries**: Keys, values, and methods (`get()`, `items()`, etc.)  
- Dictionary traversal & comprehensions  
- Hashing concepts and efficient lookups  

### 🔹 Unit 4: Comprehensions & Functions  
- **List, set, and dictionary comprehensions**  
- **Lambda functions** (`map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`)  
- Recursive functions & generator expressions  
- Custom modules & importing best practices  

### 🔹 Unit 5: NumPy & Pandas  
- **NumPy**: Creating arrays, indexing, reshaping, vectorized operations  
- **Mathematical functions** (`mean()`, `sum()`, `std()`, etc.)  
- **Pandas DataFrames**: Data loading, indexing, filtering  
- **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values, applying functions
